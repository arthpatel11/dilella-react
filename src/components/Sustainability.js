                        <p className="workpara">Since its foundation in 1968, Di Lella family has always worked in harmony with nature and the territory. Embedded in the heart of Ticino, we have access to many fresh and genuine raw material that the Alps offer and which we select
                           carefully to create our recipes. Cooperating with suppliers that are implementing sustainable agriculture practices is a must for us. We firmly believe that transparency in the whole supply chain is the key to connect people
                           and food, allowing an integrative approach to food quality.</p>

                           based on oil-based plastic. Our trays are recycled and recyclable, while still guaranteeing the highest food safety standards and shelf-life. An important part of our R&D efforts will focus on the development of low-carbon

                           of integrating organics in all food processes as the best means that can foster cycling of resources to promote ecological balance and to conserve biodiversity. The certification and our logo brings more transparency to the
                           consumers on the values that have been put into the whole production process.</p>

                           interesting and respectful working atmosphere is an efficient way to make people thrive and give the best of themselves. We regularly offer internships to young students and work since many years with local entities that supports
                           the inclusion of people with disabilities, achieving thus a diverse workforce which is socially, culturally and gender balanced.</p>
